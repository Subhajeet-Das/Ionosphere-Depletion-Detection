## <p align="justify">Day by day the Ionosphere layer is depleting in the polar regions. It is one of the major cause of global warming as due to depletion, it can't resist the Ultra-Violet Rays from the sun. So, here we are trying to analyze and detect whether the Ionosphere is at a good condition or not by using the data collected from radars in Goose Bay, Labrador over a stretch.</p>
